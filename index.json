Recently, though, there has been a shift in ideology. Now, the focus is on providing the optimum balance between performance and energy consumption, keeping the demands and priority of the user in mind. The key here is to tune the processor’s frequency and voltage to reduce energy consumption.\nAlgorithms to scale power consumption efficiently have been deployed both in hardware and in software. However, these algorithms have once again been designed with performance as the aim. The security aspects have not been paid much attention to, as is clear from the abundance of microarchitectural attacks that have sprung up over the past decade.\nOur focus is to analyze the effects of aggressive power scaling algorithms for the benefit and subsequently utilize them for the benefit of an attacker, to improve the accuracy and resolution of cache-based attacks. We critique the flush-based attacks to determine the scope for improvement. We then present a detailed analysis of one of the key components in flush-based attacks.\n","date":1574188200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1574188200,"objectID":"bde40af3ef69046c2ae8ae1b062691b6","permalink":"https://Anish-Saxena.github.io/talk/cache_optimizations/","publishdate":"2019-12-01T08:16:04+05:30","relpermalink":"/talk/cache_optimizations/","section":"talk","summary":"Identified and analyzed possible optimizations in flush-based cache attacks to improve their resolution and accuracy.","tags":["UGP","Security"],"title":"Flush-based attack optimizations","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Anish Saxena"],"categories":null,"content":"Original research paper by Tang et al.\nAbstract\nThe need for power- and energy-efficient computing has resulted in aggressive cooperative hardware-software energy management mechanisms on modern commodity devices. Most systems today, for example, allow software to control the frequency and voltage of the underlying hardware at a very fine granularity to extend battery life. Despite their benefits, these software-exposed energy management mechanisms pose grave security implications that have not been studied before.\nIn this work, we present the CLKSCREW attack, a new class of fault attacks that exploit the security-obliviousness of energy management mechanisms to break security. A novel benefit for the attackers is that these fault attacks become more accessible since they can now be conducted without the need for physical access to the devices or fault injection equipment. We demonstrate CLKSCREW on commodity ARM/Android devices. We show that a malicious kernel driver (1) can extract secret cryptographic keys from Trustzone, and (2) can escalate its privileges by loading self-signed code into Trustzone. As the first work to show the security ramifications of energy management mechanisms, we urge the community to re-examine these security-oblivious designs.\n","date":1572517800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572517800,"objectID":"a18ce7a8f117634844c32512f305fb78","permalink":"https://Anish-Saxena.github.io/talk/clkscrew/","publishdate":"2019-10-31T09:16:04+05:30","relpermalink":"/talk/clkscrew/","section":"talk","summary":"Explained the power of smart power management feature exploitation to weaken system confidentiality and integrity","tags":["CAOS","Security"],"title":"CLKscrew Attack","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Anish Saxena"],"categories":["Project"],"content":"Exploiting hardware optimizations for improving timing channel based cache attacks.

While this attack has been mitigated through stronger isolation boundaries between user and kernel space, Meltdown inspired an entirely new class of fault-driven transient execution attacks. Particularly, over the past year, Meltdown-type attacks have been extended to not only leak data from the L1 cache butalso from various other microarchitectural structures, including the FPU register file and store buffer.\nIn this paper, we present the ZombieLoad attack which uncovers a novel Meltdown-type effect in the processor’s previously unexplored fill-buffer logic. Our analysis shows that faulting load instructions (i.e., loads that have to be re-issued for either architectural or microarchitectural reasons) may transiently dereference unauthorized destinations previously brought into the fill buffer by the current or a sibling logical CPU. Hence, we report data leakage of recently loaded stale values across logical cores. We demonstrate ZombieLoad’s effectiveness in a multitude of practical attack scenarios across CPU privilege rings, OS processes, virtual machines, and SGX enclaves. We discuss both short and long-term mitigation approaches and arrive at the conclusion that disabling hyperthreading is the only possible workaround to prevent this extremely powerful attack on current processors.\n","date":1562236200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562236200,"objectID":"f564e64c0d602331ae5822365853a282","permalink":"https://Anish-Saxena.github.io/talk/zombieload/","publishdate":"2019-07-07T01:22:27Z","relpermalink":"/talk/zombieload/","section":"talk","summary":"Explained the domain of transiet-execution attacks, its types and the sub-class of microarchitectural data-sampling attacks, which ZombieLoad forms a part of","tags":["CAOS","Security"],"title":"ZombieLoad Attack","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Anish Saxena"],"categories":["Competition"],"content":"Introduction\nLed a team of 6 individuals to identify problems in campus and implement innovative solutions to combat it.\nDuration: October 2018 to December 2018\nCompetition: Inter IIT Tech Meet 2018, IIT Bombay\nDetails\n Showcased the E-Waste Management Software developed in 2017 to display optimum treatment path, given some parameters Integrated Biogas capturing mechanisms with Drum Composting to save up-to 14% of PNG consumption in Hall messes Improved upon current composting practices by integrating Smart sensors for monitoring the state of compost  ","date":1561258755,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561258755,"objectID":"384d3b24d3b78a4f4d686a7e35d342ed","permalink":"https://Anish-Saxena.github.io/project/campus_sustainence/","publishdate":"2019-06-23T08:29:15+05:30","relpermalink":"/project/campus_sustainence/","section":"project","summary":"Led a team of 6 individuals to identify problems in campus and implement innovative solutions to combat it","tags":["Development","Design"],"title":"Campus Sustainability Challenge","type":"project"},{"authors":["Anish Saxena"],"categories":["Project"],"content":"Introduction\n.NET framework based project for predictive analysis of best route to take in order to recycle E-waste given a set of initial parameters to consider\nDuration: August 2017 to November 2017\nMentor: Prof. Indranil Saha, CSE Dept.
